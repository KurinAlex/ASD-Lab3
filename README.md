# Algorithms and data structures - Lab 3

Write programs to perform 2 tasks:
1. Basic "bubble" sorting, search for elements in the array
    1) Create an array of N = 1000 elements and fill it with random integers from -2000 to 2000
    2) Write a function for sorting by the "bubble" algorithm, sort the array in ascending order
    3) Write a function to find an element in an array using linear algorithm that returns the index of the found element or -1 if no such item was found
    4) Write a function to find an element in an array using binary algorithm that returns the index of the found element or -1 if no such item was found
    5) Compare the performance of search algorithms (search in an array random numbers from -2000 to 2000), test the correctness of the algorithms.
2. Sorting by elementary algorithms according to different criteria
    1) Create an array of N = 200 elements and fill it with consecutive numbers from 1 to N
    2) Write a function to shuffle an array with the Fisher Yates algorithm, shuffle an array
    3) Write a function for sorting by the criterion of the sum of digits of number in order growth (eg 61 < 53, because 7 < 8), when equality - sort by value. 
    Sort the array by this criterion.
